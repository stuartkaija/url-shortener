# URL Shortener

[lil-url.net](https://lil-url.net/)

A URL shortening application - no more long unwieldy URLs!

This monorepo contains code for an API that does the heavy lifting of creating hashes with which to generate unique URLs and redirecting requests to existing hashed URLs; and for a frontend containing a NextJS app where a user can submit a URL to be shortened.
